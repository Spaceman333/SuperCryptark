## Status:
16.12.2018 - Version 1.2
Unstable, huge update.
Lightscheme overhaul, adding directional light variants. 
Power Reactor or its related Lightschemes may be crash-prone. raincheck on that.
The game might crash once, but work fine afterwards. Not sure, needs playtesting.
Item overhaul, all items have been renamed and reinspected.
All new character skins and new skin names.
Blacksuit recieved new color scheme.
Blacksuit also explodes nuclearly on death.
Various minor weapon tweaks, mostly graphical, thought some are tiny balance fixes.
Ghost Translocator faster projectile.
Slime Mortar accuracy improved.
Fidget Spinner a T2 weapon now, more powerful.
Pulsar and MMG lights tweaked. Needs visual testing.
Config is now set to have LowDetailMode to false by default.
The above means the lighting system is now ON by default again.


22.11.2018 - Version 1.1
Stable, contains all updates done so far, fully playable.
Still lots of new content that I want to do, like new weapons, items, lighting system overhaul and more.

## Contains:
* New weapons.
* New items.
* Overhauled weapon/item balance (less scarcity, more abundance).
* Overhauled levels, spawns and appearances.
* New special level.
* Tier system.
* Improved naming.
* Changes the entire game significantly in how it plays and feels.
