	// LIGHTSCHEMES RESEARCH DATA:
	bg color			0.8				0.8				0.1
	ambient color		0.1				0.8				0.8
	Result:				too dark		too bright		good, but maybe 0.7 is better max range.
	
	Recommended:
	============
	Ambient color - range 0.0 to 0.8 max.
	Background color - range 0.0 to 2.5 max.
	Directional light color - 0.0 to 0.5 max.
	Directional light position - 100 xy to 800xy max , z is always 0, global coords.
	Directional light direction - aimed at 0.0 to 0.1 on all xyz axis, possible global coords.
	.conclusion, all lights are placed outside far away-ish or near edges of ship, then pointed towards center.
	Inner/Outer cone - always unchanged.
	Radius, actual, min & max - always the same, unchanged too.
	Shininess - same. unchanged too.
	Strenght differs between values 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5. Advice using 1 as default, 2 as max. Anything higher felt just a tad too bright.
	Curiously, Inferno.xml uses shorter directional light definitions, missing the following lines:
		<UseOwnTime>false</UseOwnTime>
		<DisableRandomTime>false</DisableRandomTime>
		<TimeOffset>0</TimeOffset>
		<UseSpatialSystem>true</UseSpatialSystem>
		<BoundingBoxUpdateRate>0.5</BoundingBoxUpdateRate>
	Despite lacking these, the inferno lightmap works fine.
	As a reminder, Inferno.xml is used for the Hell Fortress (aka Reconstruct class) ship.

	
	No info on directional lights yet.
	
	(old)Observations so far: 
	- They have a direction defined with x,y,z coords, but I have no idea why z exists here. 
	Its actually even used for real. Is this game 2.5D or something?
	.possibly to create depth by having the light source slight off the same plane as the sprites, 
	thus allowing light to shine on them that otherwise would have hit the edges?
	- Version 1.2 uses default directional light values. I think they were too bright back then, 
	but I have not tested them with the new ambient/bg lights to see how its working out.
	-vars Radius, Strenght and Shininess have me confused as to how to use them and what are their ranges.
	Looks like its more trial and error time for me. : (
	-Despite being "directional" lights, which I assume work like the sun, blasting a wide area with uniform light
	from an infinite distance, the definitions include things like Position and Cone angle, aka properties that
	are more common for a "point" light, rather than a "directional" one. This is wierd and confuses me.
