SUPER CRYPTARK: ARMAGEDDON
==========================
Maximum Rearmed Extreme


What is this:
-------------

Super Cryptark Armageddon is a mod for Cryptark, a PC game made by Alientrap Games.

Cryptark itself is about mechs, nukes, derelict spacehulks, blowing shit up using 4 switchable guns at once, smashing hundreds of alien skeleton zombie cyborgs and just being a goddamn badass. Get the game here:

Install:
--------
1. IMPORTANT!!!: Go to Cryptark/Content/GameObjects and DELETE the Weapons, Items and Projectiles folder.
2. Unzip the archive anywhere outside the game's folder.
3. Copy/move the Content folder into your Cryptark game folder. Overwrite everything.

Thats all. Play the game, the changes will be apparent as you play the game, encounter new weapons/items and see the new ships filled with crazy enemies.

If you wish to remove the mod, just reinstall the game. Make a copy/backup of your profile save file in the Content/SavedGames folder before doing this.


Mod Description:
----------------

First of all, the intention of this mod is to provide a power fantasy, not to make the game harder. I wanted to have more ammo and less cost, so that I can shoot without counting every shot. I also wanted all weapons and items to be useful, worth their cost and powerful. This mod provides that.

The new ships are more challenging and bigger, but that is not the point of this mod. I wanted a game that I could boot up, give me randomized experience and let me blow up stuff for 30-60 minutes with some surprises created by procedural generation, so I can refresh and go continue working on other stuff.

Load up on weapons, spare no expense, hold down the trigger and kick ass, pilot.

The ARMAGEDDON is ON!
